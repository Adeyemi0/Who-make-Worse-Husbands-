A man from a dysfunctional home may become very aware of the damage he witnessed and intentionally work on himself to heal, unlearn unhealthy patterns, and become a better husband. In some cases, such men become more intentional, emotionally intelligent, and committed to breaking negative cycles. However, another man from the same background might ignore the impact of his upbringing. Even if he consciously decides not to repeat what he saw, unresolved trauma, poor emotional regulation, and learned behaviors may surface over time, and he could unintentionally become the very person he feared becoming. On the other hand, coming from a good background is a strong advantage, but it is not a guarantee of becoming a good husband. A positive upbringing provides healthy models, but personal choices, character, emotional maturity, and accountability ultimately determine how a man behaves in marriage.

Research in psychology and family studies shows that family of origin influences relationship patterns, but it does not determine outcomes. What matters more are self-awareness, emotional regulation, accountability, and willingness to learn. • Men from dysfunctional families may lack healthy models, but many become excellent husbands because they’re intentional about not repeating trauma. Therapy + self-work = pattern breaker. • Men from “good” backgrounds can still be poor husbands if they carry entitlement, emotional avoidance, or unexamined beliefs (“this is how it’s always done”). A stable home doesn’t equal emotional maturity. Studies consistently show that adult relationship success correlates more with emotional intelligence, communication skills, and conflict resolution than with childhood background alone.

Psychological research shows that upbringing influences behavior, but it’s not a determinant of individual relationships and how they turn out to behave. Learning theory, especially Albert Bandura’s Social Learning Theory, explains that people often model what they observe in childhood. Individuals raised in homes where respect, emotional support, and healthy conflict resolution were practiced are more likely to adopt similar behaviors in adulthood because those patterns feel familiar. On the other hand, those who grew up in unstable or conflict environments may initially struggle with relationship skills simply because they were not exposed to strong examples. Many people from difficult family backgrounds become highly intentional partners based on personal decisions of avoiding patterns.Having witnessed behaviors they do not want to repeat, they may actively pursue personal growth,”and development,emotional changes through education, mentorship or counseling. This self awareness can sometimes make them exceptionally thoughtful and good spouses. Though,the idea of tabula rasa by the philosopher John Locke can be said to be a significant study on grown ups, because Psychology believed that early childhood experiences shape expectations about relationships. Modern psychology also adds an important dimension of neuroplasticity, which is  brain’s ability to adapt and learn throughout life. People are capable of developing healthier communication styles, emotional regulation, and relational habits regardless of their starting point. Research consistently shows that the strongest predictors of a successful marriage are not family background but personal qualities such as emotional maturity, empathy, accountability, self control, and willingness to grow. Relationship researcher John Gottman found that destructive behaviors like contempt, defensiveness, and poor communication are far more accurate predictors of marital breakdown than upbringing alone. Protective factors like positive friendships, supportive mentors, stable adult experiences, and intentional self reflection can help individuals build strong relationship skills regardless of childhood environment. I will conclude by saying background shapes tendencies, but personal development shapes outcomes.

Unhealed patterns do. Men from dysfunctional families often grow up around instability, poor conflict resolution, emotional absence, or abuse. Research in psychology consistently shows that children can unconsciously model what they observed in adulthood. So yes, if such a man does no inner work, he may repeat cycles he never chose. But these men are also more likely to be self aware, intentional, and growth driven because pain often forces reflection. Many become excellent husbands precisely because they refused to repeat what hurt them. Men from good backgrounds often grow up with structure, provision, and social approval. Statistically, this can offer emotional advantages. But it can also create blind spots. Some men from stable homes were never taught emotional depth, accountability, or sacrifice because things worked without effort. When marriage demands pressure, some struggle because they never learned to fight for connection, only to maintain appearances.

If you are obedient or not ... Ignorant or not ... If you have a will to change or not ... 1 A man although is born with some certain traits but he is a product of nurture : The place you a born and raised can shape your mind and mentality. To some people who live in some certain towns or villages, they all grow up with a certain kind of mind set and the one who comes to deliver them must be some one from outside that has a different view of life and is nurtured specially. In the case of moses although he was born in a kind of season where things weren't funny he was taken to the kings palace and was also nurtured by his mother because God saw that it is important for him. At the end the mother nurtured him in such a way that he sees the Israelites as him brothers 2. On the case of your view of life: What you see every day can affect you badly.

He always try to get what the customers want and now his business is expanding . He will always advice us that we should travel outside jos not to enjoy but to open our mind to another different reality ...

Current psychological and relationship research shows that family background influences relationship patterns but does not determine who becomes a good or bad husband. The strongest predictors of marital success are emotional maturity, communication skills, accountability, and willingness to grow, rather than whether a man came from a dysfunctional or stable family. Influence of Family Background (Evidence-Based) Research in developmental psychology ,especially Attachment Theory (John Bowlby, Mary Ainsworth) — shows that early family environments shape: • emotional regulation • trust and attachment style • conflict resolution patterns • expectations about relationships 2. Children exposed to high conflict, neglect, or instability may carry increased risk for: • insecure attachment • communication difficulties • higher relationship stress in adulthood Similarly, large studies on Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE studies) link childhood dysfunction with higher risks of mental health challenges and interpersonal difficulties later in life. 3. Protective Effects of Stable Upbringing Men raised in supportive families often benefit from: • modeled healthy communication • emotional security • constructive conflict management • stable expectations about commitment Research consistently shows that secure attachment is associated with higher marital satisfaction and stability. But this still does not guarantee relationship success; adult behaviors matter more than childhood environment alone. 4. Adult Emotional Skills Predict Marital Success More Strongly Relationship research , particularly work by Dr. John Gottman and other marital psychologists identifies key predictors of healthy marriages: • emotional intelligence • respectful communication • accountability and responsibility • empathy and conflict regulation Couples therapy and relationship education studies show that people can significantly improve these skills, regardless of background. This supports the idea that personal growth and self-awareness outweigh upbringing alone. Growth After Dysfunctional Backgrounds Psychological literature on Post-Traumatic Growth (Tedeschi & Calhoun) shows that some individuals develop: • increased empathy • stronger commitment to stability • deeper appreciation of relationships This explains why some men from difficult homes become highly devoted partners , consciously choosing to build the stability they lacked.",0,Neutral/No clear stance,"Statistical/factual claim, Logical reasoning","family background influences relationship patterns but does not determine, strongest predictors of marital success are emotional maturity communication skills accountability and willingness to grow",Logical,"Trauma, Upbringing, Choice, Accountability",Agency-Centered,Yes,No

First of all, there’s no husband that is worse, rather there are men that are bad husbands. So, to answer your question, I will say that men from dysfunctional families have higher chances of becoming bad husbands. It takes the grace of God to unlearn a culture that was directly and indirectly inculcated in a man from childhood. A man from a dysfunctional background will be doing the wrong things ignorantly and still feels that he is actually doing the right things because that was how he was raised and that was what he saw his parents doing. So, an attempt to get him doing the right things without activating wisdom, would end up making him become worse than he already is. When the Bible says train up a child (man) in the way he should grow and when he is old he will not depart from it, God was intentionally warning parents not to raise ‘bad husbands.’ On the other hand, men from good families tends to be better and intentional about their behavior. For instance, a man who never saw his father mistreat his mother both in private and in public, will find it abnormal or even weird to mistreat his own wife because that is not the culture he was born into. The only way a man from a good family can become a bad husband is through bad companies or personal experience maybe from his past relationships but even at that, you will still know that this one is under an influence. So, men from dysfunctional families tends to make bad husbands than men from good families.

I was born and raised in a polygamous home with about 22 other siblings. Some of us that happens to be born into the family late (the younger ones), we were so disadvantaged. We were deprived of basic needs growing up including education. Me particular, started paying my school fees from JSS1. With all that happened to us I grew up with this believe that the worst thing that can ever happen to a child is to be born into a polygamous home. And I resolved not to have children from two women. So that I can be in my children life and watch them grow up. I'm not in a way saying that polygamy is a perfect definition of a dysfunctional home. Because I know some monogamy that could be described in a worst term than dysfunctional. I'm just trying to drive home my point using my personal experience. I met a lady recently that I intend to settle down with and told her about my childhood and as well my resolved. Rather than be a support to help me achieve my goal of monopoly, she decided to use that against me with very nasty attitude, maybe she felt I won't/can't do otherwise because of my resolve I discussed with her earlier. What I don't want her to do is the same thing she does even to my face. Though, proponents of the state of nature, particularly John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau would subscribe to the concept of tabula rasa. Rousseau would accused the environment for corrupting a man that was according to him born as a blank slate. That environment must not be a man first point of contact, even though it shapes him to a reasonable extend. In the last birthday celebration ofSen Jarigbe Agom, the chief of staff to the president,Femi Gbajabiamilahaving heard that the Sen had been married for over 30 years. Commended the wife for molding such a nice fellow that has become an asset to the society. I don't have so much to say about the Senator marital life neither did I know how he was raised together with his half-siblings. But the little I know shows that he is having a good home and marital life. But he was born and raised in a polygamous home. So my point is that, whether or not a man is raised from dysfunctional home doesn't have so much effect on his marriage but the wife he has does. I'm also not saying that men are angels when it comes to marital affairs. But the truth is that many girls are not marriageable.",0,Neutral/No clear stance,"Personal story, Logical reasoning","whether or not a man is raised from dysfunctional home doesn't have so much effect on his marriage but the wife he has does, quality of the wife he chooses to settle down with",Logical,"Choice, Upbringing",Agency-Centered,Yes,No

Background alone does not determine destiny. What truly shapes a person is how they have been enlightened through knowledge, guided by the Holy Spirit, and strengthened by self-awareness and personal development. While a stable and loving upbringing often makes it easier for someone to grow into a responsible and emotionally healthy adult, it does not automatically guarantee good character. In the same way, coming from a broken home does not condemn anyone to become broken. Many people rise above their past through intentional growth, discipline, and inner healing. Regardless of one’s background, true maturity depends on how much effort an individual puts into renewing their mind, refining their character, and nurturing their spirit. Growth is a personal responsibility. No one becomes better by accident; it takes humility, learning, and a willingness to change. In the end, people relate with others according to the level of their understanding and emotional intelligence. How someone treats you often reflects the depth of their reasoning, their values, and their inner state. My view is that background may shape us, but it does not define us.

A man could come from a dysfunctional home and still have a dysfunctional mentality. Also, a man could come from a dysfunctional home and still be different. (2) The wife he marries: Before someone becomes a husband, he was once single. Many men come from a dysfunctional home, but the type of wives they have reset their brain! Same is the other way round. (3) The friends he has: Some men came from a good home, but after marriage, the friends they follow corrupt them. Though his father never engaged in adultery, but his friend tell him he is not smart. Example: many husbands tend to sleep with other lady/woman when their wives are pregnant. (4) Environment: Office, location of residence, etc. You can live in a glass house and still throw stones. (5) Economy/finance: Lack of or inadequate money makes some husbands go mad. They never had shortage of cash as a bachelor, but responsibilities cum the available finance bring the other side of them. When a wife starts telling her husband that he that cannot take care of his home is worst than an unbeliever, you know the meaning. (6) Social media: Online world, interNET is another factor.

A compelling case can be made that family background does not automatically determine the quality of a husband. What matters far more is individual responsibility, self‑awareness, and the choices a man makes as an adult. 1. Family background influences behavior, but it does not determine it Research in psychology consistently shows that childhood environment shapes tendencies, but human beings are not bound to repeat their upbringing. • Studies on “intergenerational transmission” of behavior show that people from dysfunctional homes may have higher risks of conflict or poor communication—but many break the cycle through intentional effort. • Conversely, people from stable homes may have advantages, but they can still make destructive choices in adulthood. Conclusion: Background creates patterns, not destiny. 2. Adult behavior is shaped more by personal responsibility than by childhood circumstances A large body of research in developmental psychology (e.g., studies by Dr. Emmy Werner on resilience) shows that: • Many individuals from difficult backgrounds become exceptional partners because they consciously choose to do better. • Many individuals from “good homes” become poor partners because they rely on entitlement, lack self-reflection, or never learned accountability. In other words: Your past may explain you, but it does not excuse you. 3. Marriage success correlates strongly with traits that are chosen, not inherited Across multiple studies, the strongest predictors of marital satisfaction include: Predictor of Good Marriage Rooted in Background? Rooted in Personal Choice? Communication skills Partially Yes Emotional regulation Partially Yes Empathy Partially Yes Accountability No Yes Willingness to grow No Yes These are adult decisions, not childhood conditions. 4. Men from dysfunctional families often develop strong relational skills—if they choose to grow Many men who grew up in hardship: • Become more empathetic • Value stability because they lacked it • Work harder to avoid repeating negative patterns • Seek therapy or mentorship • Become intentional husbands and fathers Their background becomes motivation, not limitation. 5. Men from good families can still become poor husbands—if they lack accountability A positive upbringing does not guarantee: • Humility • Emotional maturity • Respect for a partner • Self-control • Commitment Some men from “good homes” struggle because they never had to confront their flaws or develop resilience. 6. The fairest conclusion The quality of a husband is determined by the man’s choices, not his childhood. A dysfunctional background may create challenges, but growth is a choice. A good background may create advantages, but character is a choice. The man who takes responsibility for his healing, behavior, and growth—regardless of where he came from—will make the better husband.",0,Neutral/No clear stance,"Statistical/factual claim, Logical reasoning","Family background influences behavior, but it does not determine it, Background creates patterns, not destiny, Your past may explain you, but it does not excuse you",Logical,"Trauma, Choice, Accountability, Upbringing",Agency-Centered,Yes,No

I think it ultimately comes down to intentionality and the work a man is willing to do. Background only provides a starting point, not a verdict. Research shows that self-awareness, healing, accountability, and consistent effort are stronger predictors of marital success than family origin. A healed man from a dysfunctional home will often do better than an unexamined man from a “good” background. In other words, dysfunction untreated is the problem—not dysfunction itself. A man from a broken home who confronts his wounds, seeks growth, and commits to becoming better can build a healthier marriage than a man from a “good” home who never examines himself. Likewise, a good upbringing helps—but it doesn’t replace effort. Comfort without self-awareness can still produce poor husbands. The real issue isn’t where he’s coming from, but whether he’s putting in the work. The worst husbands come from any background where a man refuses growth, correction, and accountability.

Individual traits, mental health, attachment style, and learned relationship skills matter far more than whether someone came from a “good” or “dysfunctional” family.

The one from a healthy family may feel that he has everything he needs at his beck and call, who is not properly brought up and becames careless in his choices and unintentipnal, will beome the worse husband ever and a prayer point to any partner.

They tend to overlook if truly the submissive spouse is happy with the role especially if the other spouse is not supportive. Men from such home expect the same treatment and privileges.

I understand that family background plays an important role in shaping a person, but becoming a good or bad husband is not determined solely by the kind of home one comes from. While it may be true that some men from dysfunctional homes struggle with negative patterns and have the high tendency of being a worse husbands, background alone does not decide a man’s outcome. This is where self-awareness becomes crucial. When a man recognizes unhealthy behaviors or patterns he observed while growing up, he has a choice: he can repeat them or intentionally change them. Awareness gives a person the opportunity to grow beyond his environment. That is why in the same family, you may find one or two individuals who think differently and choose a different path from the rest. Their background may be the same, but their decisions are not. For example, I observed certain patterns in my family while growing up. Becoming aware of them helped me make a conscious decision not to repeat them. That awareness set me on a path of intentional change. Likewise, a man from a good background can still become a worse husband if he ignores the values he was taught. Parents may train a child well, yet the child can still choose a different path later in life. Ultimately, what determines whether a man becomes a good or bad husband is personal responsibility. A man can either repeat negative patterns or choose to become better, regardless of his background.

Home is where a boy first learns how to be safe with another human being. If home was loud, cold, violent, unpredictable, or absent, his body learned to stay alert, not to stay connected. So when he becomes a husband, he may love deeply but panic quickly. He may want intimacy and fear it at the same time. He may shut down, explode, withdraw, or numb himself not because he wants to hurt his wife, but because his nervous system was trained for survival, not partnership and it's the nervous systems that learns first before character is instilled. Psychology say men raised in homes marked by abuse, neglect, addiction, or chronic conflict are more likely to struggle with trust, communication, emotional presence, and conflict resolution in adulthood. Studies show higher risks of substance abuse, infidelity, emotional distance, and divorce among those who grew up in unstable homes. A man who never saw apologies growing up does not know how to say “I was wrong” without feeling like he is dying. A man who watched love come with pain will confuse intensity with intimacy. A man who grew up unseen will crave affirmation but not know how to receive it. That does not make him unlovable. It makes him unfinished. Men from healthier homes often carry an advantage. They saw conflict handled without violence, affection without fear, and stability modeled, not just preached. They enter marriage with a map. Men from broken homes enter marriage with questions, sometimes with wounds, sometimes with shame they cannot name. But background alone does not decide the outcome. Some men from good families become careless husbands because they never learned self reflection. Some men from broken homes become exceptional husbands because pain forced them to seek healing, God, accountability, and truth. The real issue is not where a man comes from, but whether he has faced it. Unhealed men do not marry partners, they marry coping mechanisms. They expect a wife to fix what a childhood broke and punish love for not arriving in the form they needed as boys. That is where marriages bleed. Yes, dysfunction increases the risk, but healing changes the story. Marriage does not create problems, it reveals them. Wisdom is not asking whether his family was good.

Family background plays a major role in shaping how people understand love, communication, conflict, and emotional safety. Men who grow up in stable homes where respect, accountability, and healthy conflict resolution are modeled are more likely to internalize these behaviors and reproduce them in their own marriages. Psychology and attachment theory consistently show that secure childhood environments tend to produce adults who are better at trust, emotional regulation, and partnership. That said, coming from a dysfunctional family does not automatically make someone a bad husband. Many men from unstable homes become very intentional about breaking negative cycles precisely because they experienced the damage those environments can cause. With self-awareness, emotional maturity, therapy, mentorship, and conscious effort, they often outperform expectations and build strong, healthy marriages. On the other hand, men from “good backgrounds” are not guaranteed to be good husbands. Some may rely too heavily on their upbringing without doing the inner work required for adult relationships, or struggle when real-life pressures test the values they grew up with. The most accurate conclusion, therefore, is that a good background reduces the risk of marital problems, while a dysfunctional background increases the risk—but neither determines the outcome. What ultimately matters more than background is personal responsibility, emotional intelligence, and a willingness to grow.

This question sounds simple, but the honest answer will make many people uncomfortable. First, let’s be clear on terms. A good background does not mean a rich home, educated parents, church-going family, or a peaceful-looking house. A good background is one where: Love was expressed, not assumed Emotions were allowed, not suppressed Conflict was handled, not avoided Accountability existed Children felt safe enough to be honest A dysfunctional family is not defined by poverty or struggle. It is a home where: Emotions were unsafe or ignored Roles were confused or reversed Conflict was toxic or permanently buried Abuse of all kinds, neglect, fear, or instability was normal Problems were denied instead of addressed Now to the question. Who makes worse husbands? The uncomfortable truth is this: Neither background automatically produces a bad husband. Unhealed people do. A man from a good background can become a poor husband if: His wounds were subtle and never acknowledged. He learned silence instead of emotional honesty. He was rewarded for performance, not vulnerability. His family looked healthy, so no one thought healing was necessary. These men often struggle because their pain has no name. They appear stable, responsible, and “normal,” but they are emotionally unavailable, conflict-avoidant, defensive when confronted, unable to apologize deeply, more committed to peace than to truth. Their danger is denial. On the other hand, a man from a dysfunctional family can become a strong, self-aware husband if, he recognized early that something was wrong, refused to normalize chaos, sought healing, mentoring, faith, or growth, and chose awareness over bitterness. Such men often, are emotionally reflective, they value communication intentionally, they know how to set firm boundaries, they take responsibility seriously, and they are deliberate about not repeating what hurt them. Their strength comes from awareness and healing, not from the pain itself. So who makes worse husbands? MEN, who deny their wounds and refuse to heal. Regardless of their background. Good homes can raise wounded men who never question their patterns. Dysfunctional homes can raise healed men who break cycles. Background explains behaviour. Healing determines character. Marriage does not expose where you came from, it exposes what you dealt with. The real question every man should answer is not: “Was my family good or bad?” But: “Have I confronted what shaped me, or am I about to make my wife pay for it?” That answer, is what makes or breaks a husband, not his background.",0,Neutral/No clear stance,"Logical reasoning, Personal story","Neither background automatically produces a bad husband.

If he is from an abúsive home but decides to fóIIow the abúsive path of his parents, he will also transfer such attitude to his wife. But if he realizes that the path his parents fóllowed was wrong, he can change and become a good man to his wife. But it takes self determination and assessment to realize the abnormalities in his parents marriage, and this can happen when he listens to life changing word or counseling that might transform him. This is why a good marriage is one of the best legacies parents can leave for their kids. Legacy is not just about wealth, leave good marriage for your kids. In your marriage, try every means to make it work if you can because your kids are watching, that's where they're rooted.

Next one, a man from a good background can make a good husband and also make a bád husband. He can make a good husband if he decides to fóIIow his parents fóótsteps.

The most important truth is this: a man’s childhood—whether rough or happy—does not decide if he will be a good husband. What matters is his character now. Both kinds of men can fail in marriage, but they often fail in opposite ways. The man from a difficult home may bring loud, visible problems. If he hasn’t healed, he can bring anger, mistrust, or emotional chaos. The man from a nice, stable home may bring quiet, invisible problems. He might avoid conflict, shut down during stress, and emotionally disappear because he’s never had to work for closeness. So the most dangerous husband isn’t from one type of family—he’s the one who refuses to grow. The man from a tough past who uses his pain as an excuse to act poorly will hurt you with his actions. The man from a good past who believes he has nothing to learn will hurt you with his silence and distance. Decades of research by Dr. John Gottman confirm this. He found that marriage success depends on behavior, not background. Toxic patterns he calls “The Four Horsemen” predict divorce: Criticism, Contempt, Defensiveness, and Stonewalling. A man from a hard background may rely on Criticism and Contempt. A man from an easy background may specialize in Defensiveness and Stonewalling. Both patterns destroy love. A strong marriage is built on kindness, repair, and turning toward each other—skills anyone can learn, regardless of upbringing. The best predictor is not where a man came from, but who he chooses to be today. Look for humility, empathy, and the willingness to work on himself. A healed man from a tough past can be deeply loyal. A complacent man from a good past can leave you profoundly alone. Judge his heart, not his history.

Daughters show a 60% increase, but the focus here is on men as husbands. This suggests learned behaviors or unresolved trauma from dysfunctional homes increase instability. Males raised in never-married households are significantly less likely to marry and more likely to cheat on partners, perpetuating cycles of relational dysfunction. This aligns with broader findings that boys are more vulnerable to family instability than girls, showing higher rates of behavioral issues, lower educational attainment, and employment challenges that can strain marriages. Family-of-origin conflict correlates with worse marital quality for both spouses, as dysfunctional problem-solving strategies (e.g., avoidance, aggression, or shutdown) observed in childhood often carry over. Men from such backgrounds may exhibit these more intensely, leading to reduced satisfaction in areas like communication and emotional responsiveness.",0,Dysfunctional homes make worse husbands,"Statistical/factual claim, Logical reasoning","sons of divorced parents have a 35% higher divorce rate, learned behaviors or unresolved trauma from dysfunctional homes increase instability",Logical,"Trauma, Upbringing",Deterministic View,Yes,No

A man from a dysfunctional background has a stronger tendency to become a worse husband initially, because what he grew up with is often perceived by him as normal. Many unhealthy behaviors are internalized, not questioned, and repeated unconsciously. Until he encounters healthier models outside his upbringing, he may not recognize that anything is wrong. However, such a man can become a very good husband, father, and even emotionally healthy individual if he becomes aware and admits that his upbringing requires intentional unlearning and growth. Awareness and responsibility significantly reduce the risk. On the other hand, a man from a good background can also become either a good or a bad husband. In this case, it is largely a matter of choice and intentionality. Because he has been exposed to healthier patterns, he is more likely to recognize the difference between good and bad behaviors. However, a man from a good background can still become a worse husband if the right knowledge such as emotional skills and self-awareness are not actively developed.

The father's of the last 2 generation dropped the ball after the civil war, raising overbearing, weak or absent fathers. so the men now grew up too damaged to regulate emotionally or too weak to lead, to selfish to provide, or even assert dominance and enforce boundaries while being present, loving and compassionate. TO even understand who a man is, most men need real men to model after or get educated.

Being a good husband in my opinion goes beyond the background of the man even though his background is a major contributor to his choices and action/inactions eventually. What I consider to be a determiner to a man being a good husband or not is the habit of being ""considerate"". consideration is born out of true humility, selflessness, love and a sense of responsibility to your spouse, family and the society. I believe when as a man you are considerate about how your actions and or inactions affect your spouse and you are honest enough about the cause while active seeking the truth even amidst the discomfort the truth will be highlighting, eventually you will have a change of thought and actions that will align to the expectations you owe your spouse; being a journey good fellow. Being considerate however doesn't negate the fact that there will be disagreements which is a healthy occurrence in any relationship, it simply invites one to be ""hot"" without being ""mad"". I am looking forward  to the result of this study and how it is going to make men rethink their actions accordingly in order for us to have a healthy society.",0,Neutral/No clear stance,Logical reasoning,"Being a good husband in my opinion goes beyond the background, What I consider to be a determiner to a man being a good husband or not is the habit of being ""considerate""",Logical,"Choice, Accountability, Upbringing",Agency-Centered,Yes,No
